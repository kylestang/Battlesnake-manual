# A Manual [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com)

This is a short side-project to have a human play in a programming competition. There are, as far as I can tell, no rules against human players.
Simply press the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake, exactly like the original snake game.
Automatic assistance is used only to avoid crashing, all other decisions are made by the player.
